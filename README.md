# No Chilli

No Chilli is a fast-paced platformer. You play as Chiliman, who is being chased by a giant determined to eat him. Run fast, bounce off walls, and perform expert turns to evade him and reach the glass of milk! 

The game is intended to be simply a side-project and meant to be a fun tool to sharpen my development skills.
